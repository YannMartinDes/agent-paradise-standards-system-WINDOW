# APS-V1-0000.DI01  -  Distribution & Installation (Specification)

**Version**: 1.1.0
**Status**: Active
**Parent**: APS-V1-0000 (Meta-Standard)

---

## Distribution Model

The governing decision for how standards are distributed is recorded in
[ADR-0002: crates.io as Standard Distribution Transport](../../../docs/adrs/0002-crates-io-distribution.md).

In summary, and as reflected throughout this specification:

- crates.io is the distribution transport for official standards. Each
  official standard publishes as one crate, and substandards ship as cargo
  features of that parent crate rather than as separate published crates
  (cross-ref SS01).
- APSS bundles are RETAINED as an optional offline, development, and
  air-gapped mechanism (the `--bundle-dir` install path) and as a catalog
  format that describes which standards, versions, and features travel
  together. They are no longer the required transport.

ADR-0002 supersedes the earlier bundle-as-transport language. Where this
document describes bundles, treat them as the offline and catalog format
unless the text explicitly says otherwise.

---

## Terminology

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119).

---

## 1. Scope

This substandard defines:

- How official standards are packaged and published as crates.io crates, with
  substandards shipped as cargo features of the parent crate (ADR-0002)
- The APSS bundle format used as the offline, development, and catalog
  mechanism, and how Rust crates are used as implementation artifacts
- The bootstrap CLI binary used for project onboarding (canonical binary name
  is being resolved in repo issue 64; this spec refers to it as the
  "bootstrap" where the name can be avoided)
- The installation workflow that reads the `APSS.yaml` manifest defined by
  CF01 and resolves, fetches, locks, and composes the standards it declares
- The lockfile format (`apss.lock`)
- Code generation for composed project-local binaries
- The seam between CF01 (manifest), DI01 (resolution and packaging), and each
  standard's install contract that the unified installer invokes

---

## 2. Standard Publishing And The Bundle Format

### 2.1 Distribution Boundary

The standard distribution transport is crates.io (ADR-0002). Each official
standard MUST publish as one crate (for example `apss-v1-0001-code-topology`).
Substandards MUST NOT be separate published crates; substandard code ships as
cargo features of the parent standard crate (cross-ref SS01). Experiments
publish under their experiment name. The APSS CLI, bootstrap binary, GitHub
Action, and language-specific wrappers are distributed through crates.io, npm,
binary releases, or other tooling package managers.

APSS bundles are RETAINED as an OPTIONAL offline, development, and air-gapped
mechanism, consumed through the `apss install --bundle-dir <path>` path, and
as a catalog format (Sections 2.2 to 2.4). Bundles are not the required
transport for standards.

This separates two concerns:

- Tooling distribution installs the APSS tools.
- Standard distribution installs APSS standards and explicitly declared
  experiments into a consumer repository from crates.io, with bundles
  available as the offline and catalog fallback.

### 2.2 Bundle Naming Convention

Sections 2.2 to 2.4 define the offline and catalog bundle format. They apply
to the optional `--bundle-dir` development, offline, and air-gapped path, not
to the crates.io transport described in Section 2.1.

When a bundle is produced, its directory and archive filename MUST follow:

```
APS-V1-NNNN-<slug>-<version>.apss
```

For official standards, `NNNN` is the 4-digit standard ID, `<slug>` is the
kebab-case slug, and `<version>` is the SemVer version from the package
metadata. Experimental standard bundles MUST use the same shape with
`EXP-V1-NNNN` as the ID prefix:

```
EXP-V1-NNNN-<slug>-<version>.apss
```

Examples:
- `APS-V1-0001-code-topology-1.0.0.apss`
- `APS-V1-0000.DI01-distribution-1.0.0.apss`
- `EXP-V1-0003-fitness-functions-0.1.0.apss`

### 2.3 Required Bundle Contents

When a bundle is produced for the offline or catalog path, it MUST contain:

- `bundle.toml`, the APSS bundle manifest
- The source package metadata file, such as `standard.toml` or
  `substandard.toml`
- `docs/` when documentation exists in the source package
- Runtime or validation artifacts required by the standard
- Implementation source required to build or execute the standard

Generated build outputs such as `target/` MUST NOT be included.

### 2.4 Bundle Manifest

When a bundle is produced, its `bundle.toml` MUST use this schema:

```toml
schema = "apss.bundle/v1"
id = "APS-V1-0001"
name = "Code Topology"
slug = "code-topology"
version = "1.0.0"
kind = "standard"
metadata_file = "standard.toml"

[source]
package_path = "standards/v1/APS-V1-0001-code-topology"
repository = "https://github.com/AgentParadise/agent-paradise-standards-system"

[payload]
metadata = "standard.toml"
docs = "docs"
implementation = "."
```

Substandard bundles MUST set `kind = "substandard"` and use the substandard
ID, name, slug, version, and `metadata_file = "substandard.toml"`.

Experimental standard bundles MUST set `kind = "experiment"` and use
`metadata_file = "experiment.toml"`.

Promoted official standard bundles MAY include a promotion alias table:

```toml
[[promoted_from]]
id = "EXP-V1-0003"
slug = "fitness-functions"
last_experiment_version = "0.4.0"
compatibility = "config-compatible"
```

The `compatibility` value MUST be one of:

- `config-compatible` when the promoted standard accepts the experiment's
  config unchanged.
- `migration-adapter` when the promoted standard ships code that translates
  the experiment config.
- `manual-migration-required` when automatic resolution is unsafe.

### 2.5 Implementation Crate Naming

When a bundle contains a Rust implementation crate, the crate SHOULD follow
the existing APSS naming convention:

```
apss-v1-NNNN-<slug>
```

Substandard implementation crates SHOULD follow:

```
apss-v1-NNNN-<profile>-<slug>
```

These names are implementation details used by composition and build
generation. They are not the public standard package identifiers.

### 2.6 Required Exports

Rust implementation crates used by bundles MUST export:

```rust
pub fn register(registry: &mut dyn apss_core::StandardRegistry) {
    // Register this standard's CLI handler
}
```

### 2.7 Dependencies

Rust implementation crates MUST depend on `apss-core` for shared traits.

### 2.8 Configuration Export

Standard implementation crates MUST export a type implementing
`StandardConfig` or use `NoConfig`. See CF01 and meta-standard Section 8.3.

---

## 3. Bootstrap Binary

### 3.1 Purpose

The bootstrap binary is a lightweight CLI installed globally via
`cargo install <bootstrap>`. It handles project onboarding and unified
installation. The canonical binary name is being resolved in repo issue 64;
this spec uses `<bootstrap>` where the name can be avoided.

### 3.2 Bootstrap Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `<bootstrap> init` | Create `APSS.yaml` |
| `<bootstrap> install` | Read `APSS.yaml`, resolve, run per-standard install contracts, build composed binary |
| `<bootstrap> install --check` | Report what install would do without writing |
| `<bootstrap> install --locked` | CI mode, fail if lockfile would change |
| `<bootstrap> install --update <slug>` | Update one standard |
| `<bootstrap> install --offline` | Use only cached crates |
| `<bootstrap> uninstall <slug>` | Invoke a single standard's uninstall contract |
| `<bootstrap> status` | Show project config and installed versions |
| `<bootstrap> validate` | Validate project against all standards |
| `<bootstrap> validate --config-only` | Validate only the manifest |
| `<bootstrap> config show <slug>` | Show resolved config for a standard |
| `<bootstrap> config schema <slug>` | Show JSON Schema for config |
| `<bootstrap> config template` | Generate config with defaults |
| `<bootstrap> run <slug> <cmd>` | Delegate to composed binary |

### 3.3 Delegation

When the bootstrap receives `<bootstrap> run ...`, it delegates to the
composed binary at `.apss/bin/<bootstrap>`. If the binary does not exist, it
prints a helpful error directing the user to run `<bootstrap> install`.

---

## 4. Installation Workflow

The unified installer reads the `APSS.yaml` manifest (CF01 Section 2),
resolves the standards it declares, drives each resolved standard's install
contract, then composes the project-local binary. CF01 owns the manifest;
DI01 owns resolution and the lockfile; each standard owns its install
contract. The pipeline below stitches the three together.

### 4.1 Install Pipeline

1. Parse and validate `APSS.yaml` via CF01 (with cascade applied for
   workspaces). Refuse to proceed on any error-severity diagnostic.
2. Resolve version ranges against crates.io (Cargo is the registry, ADR-0002),
   or against a local bundle directory or local repository when the offline
   `--bundle-dir` or `--local-repo` path is used, producing one
   `ResolvedStandard` per `standards.<slug>` entry in the manifest.
3. Apply promoted-experiment aliases for any requested `EXP-V1-XXXX` package
   whose registry entry points to an official `APS-V1-XXXX` replacement
   (Section 4.2).
4. Write or update `apss.lock` (Section 5).
5. For each `ResolvedStandard`, load its install contract
   (`docs/02_install_contract.md` in the standard's package) and ask it for
   an install plan in dry-run mode.
6. Apply each install plan in dependency order. Standards may install git
   hooks, scaffolds, validators, and other artifacts per their contract.
7. Reconcile removals: any standard previously present in `apss.lock` but
   absent or `enabled: false` in the current manifest MUST have its
   uninstall contract invoked. Removal MUST leave operator data and source
   code untouched.
8. Generate `.apss/build/Cargo.toml` with resolved standard crate
   dependencies (registry dependencies by default, with the selected
   substandard features; path or bundle sources in offline mode).
9. Generate `.apss/build/src/main.rs` with `register()` calls.
10. Run `cargo build --release --manifest-path .apss/build/Cargo.toml`.
11. Copy binary to `.apss/bin/<bootstrap>`.

The pipeline MUST be idempotent: re-running with an unchanged manifest and
registry MUST be a no-op (no file rewrites, no rebuild, exit zero).

### 4.2 Promoted Experiment Resolution

DI01 MUST support experimental standards declared in `APSS.yaml`. If an
`EXP-V1-XXXX` package exists in the registry, resolution proceeds normally
and the resulting package is marked experimental in the lockfile.

If the requested experiment has been promoted and the registry exposes a
promotion alias, DI01 MUST resolve the request to the promoted
`APS-V1-XXXX` package when compatibility is `config-compatible` or
`migration-adapter`. The installer MUST emit a warning diagnostic that
includes:

- The requested experimental ID and slug.
- The resolved official ID and slug.
- The compatibility mode.
- A recommendation to update `APSS.yaml`.

If compatibility is `manual-migration-required`, DI01 MUST fail resolution
with an error diagnostic and a migration path. It MUST NOT silently skip the
standard, drop validation, or leave the project unenforced.

Promoted alias resolution MUST be deterministic. Given the same registry
index, `APSS.yaml`, and lockfile, resolution MUST produce the same official
package and diagnostics.

### 4.3 Locked Mode

`<bootstrap> install --locked` MUST fail if the resolved versions or the
per-standard install plans would change `apss.lock`. This is intended for
CI environments.

### 4.4 Per-standard Install Contracts

Every standard MUST ship `docs/02_install_contract.md`, which is the
per-standard lifecycle hook the unified installer invokes. The contract
MUST define `install`, `uninstall`, and a `plan` mode, each with stable
diagnostics. The `StandardCli` trait (CL01) is the in-process API the
installer uses to reach the contract.

The per-standard escape hatch MUST remain supported as a debugging aid:

```
<bootstrap> run <slug> install
<bootstrap> run <slug> uninstall
```

Documentation MUST present the unified `install` command as the primary path
and the per-standard form as a secondary escape hatch.

### 4.5 CF01 to DI01 Seam

The boundary between CF01 and DI01 is explicit:

- CF01 hands DI01 an ordered list of `(slug, id, version, substandards)`
  tuples derived from the manifest, the cascade, and the slug registry.
- DI01 returns a `ResolvedStandard` per tuple, containing the pinned
  version, the checksum, source descriptor (registry, bundle path, git), and
  any promoted-experiment alias that was applied.
- The installer then drives the per-standard install contracts using those
  `ResolvedStandard` values.
- DI01 owns no knowledge of standard configuration content. CF01 owns no
  knowledge of how a version range is resolved against a registry. Each
  standard owns its own install contract content.

---

## 5. Lockfile Format

### 5.1 Location

The lockfile MUST be at `apss.lock` in the project root, next to
`APSS.yaml`.

### 5.2 Schema

```toml
schema = "apss.lock/v1"

[core]
version = "1.0.0"
checksum = "sha256:..."

[[package]]
id = "APS-V1-0001"
slug = "topology"
crate_name = "apss-v1-0001-code-topology"
version = "1.2.0"
checksum = "sha256:..."
source = "registry+https://crates.io"
requested_id = "EXP-V1-0003"
requested_slug = "fitness-functions"
resolved_from = "promoted-experiment"

substandards = [
    { profile = "RS01", crate_name = "apss-v1-0001-rs01-rust", version = "1.0.0", checksum = "sha256:..." },
]
```

### 5.3 Source Types

The `source` field supports:
- `registry+<url>`  -  fetched from a crate registry
- `path+<relative>`  -  local path (for development)
- `git+<url>?rev=<sha>`  -  git source

### 5.4 Version Control

`apss.lock` SHOULD be committed to version control for reproducibility. `.apss/build/` SHOULD be gitignored.

If DI01 resolves a promoted experiment, `apss.lock` MUST record both the
requested experimental identity and the resolved official identity. This
allows future installs to detect whether the operator has updated
`APSS.yaml`, and it makes audit trails clear during experiment promotion.

---

## 6. Code Generation

### 6.1 Generated Crate

`<bootstrap> install` generates a minimal Rust crate at `.apss/build/`:

```
.apss/
├── build/
│   ├── Cargo.toml     # Generated deps
│   └── src/
│       └── main.rs    # Generated register() + dispatch
└── bin/
    └── <bootstrap>    # Compiled binary
```

### 6.2 Determinism

Code generation MUST be deterministic: the same `APSS.yaml` and `apss.lock`
MUST produce identical generated files.

---

## 7. .gitignore Recommendations

Consumer projects SHOULD add:

```gitignore
.apss/build/
.apss/bin/
```

And SHOULD commit:
- `APSS.yaml`
- `apss.lock`

---

## 8. Versioning Model

### 8.1 Version Tiers

The system has two independent version tracks:

| Tier | Scope | Pattern | Source of truth |
|------|-------|---------|-----------------|
| **System** | `apss-core`, `aps-cli`, `apss` bootstrap | `1.x.y` | `[workspace.package].version` in root `Cargo.toml` |
| **Standard** | Each standard/substandard independently | SemVer | `standard.toml` / `substandard.toml` version field |

The system version MUST track `1.x.y` to align with `APS-V1`. It is bumped on
any change to system crates (`apss-core`, `aps-cli`, `apss`).

Standard and substandard versions are independent: a standard MAY be at
`3.0.0` while the system is at `1.2.0`. Consumer projects pin standard
versions in `APSS.yaml` via semver ranges.

Experimental standards MAY be distributed and pinned with `EXP-V1-XXXX`
identities. Promotion to an official standard creates a new official identity
and MAY keep the experiment's version lineage or reset to `1.0.0`. The
promotion alias, not SemVer alone, defines the compatibility bridge from the
experimental identity to the official identity.

### 8.2 Version Consistency

For each standard/substandard/experiment:

- The version in `Cargo.toml` MUST match the version in the metadata file
  (`standard.toml`, `substandard.toml`, or `experiment.toml`)
- Standards using `version.workspace = true` in `Cargo.toml` are exempt
  (workspace version is managed centrally)
- The `DI_VERSION_MISMATCH` error is raised if these diverge

### 8.3 Version Bump Enforcement

When merging from `main` to `release`:

- If any file within a standard's directory has changed since the last release,
  the standard's version MUST have been bumped
- If any system crate (`crates/apss-core`, `crates/aps-cli`, `crates/apss-bootstrap`)
  has changed, the workspace version MUST have been bumped
- The release gate MUST fail if a version bump is missing

### 8.4 Backward Compatibility

Published crate versions MUST follow SemVer:

- A consumer project using `apss-v1-0001 = ">=1.0, <2.0"` MUST continue to
  work with any `1.x.y` release of that standard
- System crate updates (e.g., `apss-core` `1.1.0` → `1.2.0`) MUST NOT break
  previously published standards  -  the `apss-core` API is a stability contract

---

## 9. Release Pipeline

### 9.1 Release Flow

```
main ──PR──► release branch
               │
               ├── release-gate (required checks)
               └── on merge → release-create
```

### 9.2 Release Gate (PR to release)

The release gate MUST validate:

1. `just ci` passes (format, lint, typecheck, test, build, aps-validate)
2. `apss-dev v1 validate distribution` passes (hard gate, not advisory)
3. Version bump detected for every changed standard/substandard
4. System version bumped if any system crate changed
5. `cargo audit` passes (supply chain security)
6. PR body contains a changelog section

### 9.3 Release Creation (merge to release)

On merge to `release`:

1. Manual approval via GitHub Environment (`release-publish`)
2. Create git tags:
   - System tag: `v1.x.y` (if system version changed)
   - Per-standard tags: `APS-V1-NNNN-vX.Y.Z` (for each bumped standard)
   - Per-substandard tags: `APS-V1-NNNN.PP01-vX.Y.Z` (for each bumped substandard)
3. Create GitHub Release with changelog from PR body
4. Publish to crates.io in dependency order (ADR-0002):
   - Tier 1: `apss-core` (when the system version changed)
   - Tier 2: each changed official standard crate, in dependency order, with
     the same already-published idempotency guard
   - Tier 3: `apss` bootstrap binary (when the system version changed)
5. Previously published versions remain available  -  consumers are not forced
   to upgrade

### 9.4 Publish Scope

Per ADR-0002, the following crates are published to crates.io:

- APSS tooling crates (`apss-core` and the `apss` bootstrap binary).
- Official standard crates, one per official standard (for example
  `apss-v1-0001-code-topology`).
- Experiment crates, published under their `EXP-V1-XXXX` experiment name.

The meta-standard internal substandard crates (CF01, DI01, CL01, SS01) remain
UNPUBLISHED. They are consumer-internal governance packages, not public
distribution units, and may retain separate workspace crates. This carve-out
may be revisited.

This supersedes the earlier rule that standard distribution must use APSS
bundles. crates.io is the standard transport (Section 2.1); bundles are the
optional offline and catalog format. The system MUST work with any
combination of previously published standard crate versions within their
declared semver compatibility ranges.
