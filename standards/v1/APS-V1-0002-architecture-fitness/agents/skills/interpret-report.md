# interpret-report

Read and explain a fitness report, focusing on actionable insights.

## Usage

```
User: "explain fitness report" | "what are the violations" | "show system fitness"
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| report_path | No | `fitness-report.json` | Path to the fitness report |

## Procedure

1. Read `fitness-report.json`
2. Present the system-level fitness score prominently
3. Show per-dimension scores with visual indicators (bar chart). For each
   dimension surface its `promotion_status` (`active` / `incubating`) and
   `enforcement` (`enforced` / `advisory`) so users can tell which findings
   would block CI vs which are advisory only.
4. If trend data is available, show deltas and highlight regressions
5. For failed rules, list each violation with:
   - Entity path
   - Actual value vs threshold
   - Whether it's excepted or not
   - Which issue tracks it (if excepted)
6. For stale exceptions, recommend cleanup actions
7. Provide prioritized recommendations:
   - Which dimension to focus on (lowest score)
   - Which violations have the highest impact
   - Whether the system score trend is improving or declining

## Output Format

```
System Fitness: 0.78 / 0.70 (PASS)

Dimensions:
  MT01 Maintainability:  0.92  ████████████████████░░  (+0.03 ↑)
  MD01 Modularity:       0.71  ██████████████░░░░░░░░  (-0.05 ↓)
  ...

Failures (1):
  [FAIL] max-main-sequence-distance (MD01)
    packages.data-access: D = 0.85 (threshold: 0.7)
    → This module is in the Zone of Pain (concrete + stable)
    → Consider adding abstractions or reducing incoming dependencies

Recommendations:
  1. MD01 declined by 0.05 - investigate new coupling in recent commits
  2. packages.data-access needs refactoring (Zone of Pain)
```

## Error Handling

| Error | Recovery |
|-------|----------|
| Report file not found | Suggest running `validate-fitness` first |
| Report version mismatch | Warn about version and attempt best-effort parsing |
