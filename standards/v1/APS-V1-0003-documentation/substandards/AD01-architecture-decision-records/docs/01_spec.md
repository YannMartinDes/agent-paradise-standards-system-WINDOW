# ADR Enforcement Specification

- **Substandard:** APS-V1-0003.AD01
- **Parent:** APS-V1-0003 (Documentation and Context Engineering)
- **Version:** 0.1.0

Key words: MUST, MUST NOT, SHOULD, SHALL per [RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119).

This substandard's vocabulary, lifecycle, naming guidance, and shipped template default to the canonical community resource at <https://github.com/architecture-decision-record/architecture-decision-record>. The Michael Nygard template referenced in section 7 of this spec is the one cited by that resource. See ADR01 overview (`docs/00_overview.md`) for the cited definitions of ADR, AD, ADL, ASR, AKM and the four characteristics of a good ADR.

## 1. ADR Directory (ADR01-dir-not-found)

The docs root (default `docs/`) MUST contain an ADR directory (default `adrs/`).

- Configurable via `docs.adr.directory` in `apss.yaml`
- Full path: `<docs.root>/<docs.adr.directory>/` (e.g., `docs/adrs/`)
- The ADR directory SHOULD contain a `README.md` with a `## Index` section listing all ADRs (managed by the parent standard's index generation)

## 2. Naming Convention (ADR01-invalid-naming)

Every file in the ADR directory MUST match the configured naming pattern, with the following exclusions applied first:

- Structural docs files: `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md` (the directory itself is a docs subdirectory and these are the parent standard's structural files).
- Template files with the suffix `.example` (the installer materialises the shipped Nygard template as `ADR-000-template.md.example`; see Install Contract Section 1.4). The validator MUST NOT count `.example` files as ADRs for naming, frontmatter, status, keyword, or backlink purposes. The parent indexer MUST NOT include them in the generated index.

**Default pattern:** `ADR-\d{3,5}-[a-zA-Z0-9-]+\.md`

**Examples:**
- `ADR-001-initial-architecture.md`
- `ADR-042-security.md`
- `ADR-100-api-versioning-strategy.md`

**Format:** `ADR-<number>-<kebab-case-name>.md`

- The number MUST be zero-padded to at least 3 digits (maximum 5 digits)
- The name MUST use kebab-case (lowercase letters, digits, hyphens)
- Configurable via `docs.adr.naming_pattern` in `apss.yaml`

## 3. Front Matter (ADR01-missing-frontmatter, ADR01-invalid-status)

Every ADR file MUST contain a YAML front matter block with:

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | YES | Human-readable ADR title |
| `description` | YES | One-line summary of the decision |
| `status` | YES | Lifecycle status: `proposed`, `accepted`, `deprecated`, or `superseded` |

ADRs should not be revised - they should be superseded by a new ADR. The `status` field enables agents and tooling to skip superseded decisions and focus on active ones.

**Example:**

```yaml
---
name: "Security Architecture"
description: "Defines authentication, authorization, and data protection patterns"
status: accepted
---
```

## 4. Required ADR Keywords (ADR01-missing-required-keyword)

Projects MAY configure required ADR topics via `docs.adr.required_adr_keywords`:

```yaml
docs:
  adr:
    required_adr_keywords: ["security", "testing", "deployment"]
```

For each keyword, at least one file whose stem matches the configured
`docs.adr.naming_pattern` and ends in `-<keyword>` MUST exist. The
keyword matcher is derived from `naming_pattern`, so a project that
customises the prefix (e.g., `DEC-...`) gets a keyword check that follows
its convention. The number prefix is flexible; only the keyword suffix is
enforced.

**Example:** With `required_adr_keywords: ["security"]`, any of these satisfy the requirement:
- `ADR-001-security.md`
- `ADR-042-security.md`

This mechanism lets the standard grow a base set of required architectural topics as the project matures.

## 5. Backlinking (ADR01-missing-backlink, reserved)

Backlinking is an always-on part of the standard: implementation files reference
the ADR they implement so context is never lost across plan, design, and impl.
The disable flag exists only as a per-project escape hatch; it is not the
intended default.

When `docs.backlinking.disable` is `false`, implementation files that are governed by an ADR SHOULD contain a reference to the ADR identifier.

**ADR identifier format:** `ADR-XXX-<name>` (the filename without `.md`)

**Example:** A source file implementing the security ADR should contain:

```rust
// Implements ADR-001-security
```

This enables bidirectional discovery:
- From code → ADR: developers and agents find the governing decision
- From ADR → code: `grep ADR-001-security` finds all implementing files

## 6. ADR Reference Accuracy (ADR01-unknown-reference, ADR01-superseded-reference, ADR01-deprecated-reference)

This is the mechanical enforcement of the parent-level backlinking rule for
ADRs. The validator scans source files across the repository for ADR
identifiers and validates that each referenced ADR resolves to a real file
in the configured ADR directory.

### 6.1 Reference scan (normative)

When backlinking is enabled, the validator MUST:

1. Walk the project tree, including files matched by
   `docs.backlinking.scan` (per the parent spec Section 7.2; the
   defaults documented in Section 3.3 of the parent spec apply when the
   key is absent), and skipping hidden directories, the configured
   `docs.readme.exclude_dirs`, and the ADR directory itself. The
   deprecated `docs.backlinking.file_types` key MUST be honoured for
   backward compatibility per the parent spec; tooling MUST emit
   `backlinking-file-types-deprecated` (warning) when it is set so
   the operator migrates to `scan`.
2. For every walked file, extract every token of the form
   `ADR-<NNN>-<slug>` where `<NNN>` is 3 to 5 digits and `<slug>` matches
   the slug fragment of the configured `docs.adr.naming_pattern`. The
   reference-extraction regex MUST be derived from
   `docs.adr.naming_pattern`, so projects that customise the prefix
   (for example `DEC-...`) still get their references scanned.
3. For every extracted token, look up the matching file name
   `<token>.md` in the configured ADR directory.

### 6.2 Resolution rules

Every extracted token MUST resolve to a real ADR file. A reference resolves
when:

- A file named `<token>.md` exists in `<docs.root>/<docs.adr.directory>/`.
- That file's name satisfies `docs.adr.naming_pattern` (so a file added by
  hand without the correct shape does not silently "resolve" a reference).

A reference that does not resolve MUST be reported as
`ADR01-unknown-reference` (severity: error). The diagnostic MUST include
the source file path, the line number where the token appears, and the
offending token verbatim, so the operator can jump straight to the bad
reference. Without file and line the diagnostic is non-actionable and MUST
NOT be emitted.

`ADR01-unknown-reference` is the substandard's strict accuracy code and
supersedes the parent-level `backlink-dead-reference` warning for ADRs.
When `ADR01-unknown-reference` is applicable, the validator MUST NOT also
emit `backlink-dead-reference` for the same finding.

### 6.3 Stale reference (split by lifecycle status)

A resolved reference whose target ADR has `status: superseded` MUST
be reported as `ADR01-superseded-reference` (severity: warning) so
the operator can retarget the backlink to the current ADR. The
hint MUST name the value of the target ADR's `superseded_by` field
so the retarget is unambiguous.

A resolved reference whose target ADR has `status: deprecated` MUST
be reported as `ADR01-deprecated-reference` (severity: warning).
Deprecated ADRs are "discouraged but still informative" per the
shared lifecycle vocabulary; a code file may legitimately keep the
backlink to preserve historical context, so the diagnostic message
MUST suggest "retarget or annotate this reference as intentional"
rather than asserting the reference is wrong.

The two diagnostics MUST NOT be merged under a single code: an
adopter who wants to filter superseded-only or deprecated-only in
CI cannot do so when the same code covers both. Both diagnostics
MUST include the source file path, the line number, and the
offending token verbatim, identically to `ADR01-unknown-reference`.

### 6.4 Placement guidance for the operator

The parent spec (Section 7.1.1 of `APS-V1-0003/docs/01_spec.md`) defines
two equally valid backlink placements: a top-of-file header comment for a
file whose whole purpose is one or more ADRs, and a per-function or
per-block comment for ADRs that scope to a single unit. The reference
validator picks up tokens regardless of which placement is chosen; the
docs-area `AGENTS.md` template (`templates/docs/adrs/AGENTS.md`) repeats
the guidance so agents see it in the ADR directory itself.

### 6.5 Scope summary

**Scanned file set:** every file matched by `docs.backlinking.scan`
(default include-globs documented in Section 3.3 of the parent spec
cover `**/*.rs`, `**/*.py`, `**/*.ts`, `**/*.tsx`, `**/*.js`,
`**/*.jsx`, `**/*.go`, `**/*.java`, `**/*.kt`, `**/*.rb`, `**/*.sh`,
`**/*.yaml`, `**/*.yml`, `**/*.toml`, `**/*.json`, `**/*.md`). The
deprecated `file_types` key MAY widen the set during migration.

**Excluded from scanning:** hidden directories, configured `exclude_dirs`,
and files inside the ADR directory itself (so an ADR's own body can
reference other ADRs without tripping the validator).

**Severity:** error (`ADR01-unknown-reference`), warning
(`ADR01-superseded-reference`), warning
(`ADR01-deprecated-reference`).

**Controlled by:** `docs.backlinking.disable` in `apss.yaml`. When backlinking
is disabled all three codes are suppressed.

### 6.6 Migration from `ADR01-dead-reference`

Earlier drafts of this spec defined `ADR01-dead-reference` (warning) for
the same finding. The renamed code is `ADR01-unknown-reference` and the
severity is upgraded from warning to error. Downstream tooling that
filters on the older code MUST migrate to the new name. The migration is
a one-way upgrade; the old code is not retained as an alias.

## 7. Required ADR Headers (ADR01-missing-header)

Every ADR file SHOULD contain the standard ADR section headers:

- `## Context` - the forces at play
- `## Decision` - the change being proposed or made
- `## Consequences` - what happens as a result

Header matching is case-insensitive and tolerates extra whitespace.

**Severity:** warning (ADR01-missing-header)

## 8. ADR Context Files (ADR01-missing-context-file, ADR01-context-missing-guidance)

The ADR directory MUST contain `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` files that provide guidance on how ADRs should be referenced in implementation code.

These context files serve a specific purpose beyond the parent standard's generic context file requirement: they instruct agents and developers to add a comment block at the top of files that implement an ADR, keeping the governing decision in context when making updates.

**Required content:** Each file SHOULD mention how to reference ADRs in code. The validator checks for keywords like `ADR-`, `backlink`, `reference`, or `comment block`.

**Example CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md for the ADR directory:**

```markdown
# Architecture Decision Records

Files that implement an ADR should reference it in a comment block at the top of the file.

Example:
```
// Implements ADR-001-security
```

This keeps agents and developers in context when making updates to the codebase.
Use `grep ADR-001-security` to find all files implementing a given ADR.
```

**Severity:**
- Missing file: error (ADR01-missing-context-file)
- File exists but lacks referencing guidance: warning (ADR01-context-missing-guidance)

Guidance detection is case-insensitive, so casing variants like `Reference`
or `BACKLINK` do not produce false `ADR01-context-missing-guidance` warnings.

## 9. Configuration

```yaml
docs:
  adr:
    directory:             "adrs"                   # ADR directory name under docs root
    naming_pattern:        "ADR-\\d{3,5}-[a-zA-Z0-9-]+\\.md" # File naming regex
    required_adr_keywords: []                       # Required topic keywords
```

## 10. ADR Template

The standard provides a default ADR template with the required front matter fields and section headers. Tooling MAY use this template to scaffold new ADRs:

```bash
aps run docs new adr <name>     # Scaffold a new ADR from template (future CLI)
```

The template includes:
- Front matter with `name`, `description`, and `status: proposed`
- Required sections: `## Context`, `## Decision`, `## Consequences`

Projects MAY customize the template. An example template is provided in the standard's `examples/adr-template.md`.

---

## 11. Error Codes

Codes follow the form `ADR01-<verb-phrase>`. The substandard prefix keeps the
rule domain visible; the suffix reads as plain English in CLI output. This
matches the operator invariant for human-readable codes.

| Code | Severity | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| ADR01-dir-not-found | error | ADR directory does not exist |
| ADR01-invalid-naming | error | File does not match naming pattern |
| ADR01-missing-frontmatter | error | Missing or incomplete front matter |
| ADR01-missing-required-keyword | error | Required ADR keyword not satisfied |
| ADR01-missing-backlink | - | Reserved (forward backlink enforcement not feasible) |
| ADR01-invalid-naming-regex | error | Invalid naming regex in configuration |
| ADR01-missing-context-file | error | ADR directory missing CLAUDE.md or AGENTS.md |
| ADR01-context-missing-guidance | warning | ADR context file lacks ADR referencing guidance |
| ADR01-unknown-reference | error | Source file references an ADR token that does not resolve to a real file in `docs.adr.directory` matching `docs.adr.naming_pattern` (replaces the earlier `ADR01-dead-reference` warning) |
| ADR01-missing-header | warning | ADR file missing required section header |
| ADR01-invalid-status | error | ADR missing or invalid `status` field |
| ADR01-superseded-reference | warning | Source file references an ADR whose `status` is `superseded`; hint MUST name the target's `superseded_by` value |
| ADR01-deprecated-reference | warning | Source file references an ADR whose `status` is `deprecated`; hint MUST suggest "retarget or annotate as intentional" |
